        <h4><strong>About me:</strong></h4>
          <p>My name is <span class="highlight"><Strong>Anthony Golovin</strong></span>, I was born an raised in the United States of America although the rest of my family was actually born in Russia.
            My initial interest in technology came from a very young age through hobbies like gaming. As I grew older I found myself lacking direction and passion which stopped me from going to college as I did not know what I was going to do,
            at the time I was working at AT&T sales and it clickedfor me that I wanted to be involved in technology and not sell it. I quickly got my foot in the door by
            starting to work at 343 Industries to do QA work on <span class="highlight"><em>Halo: Infinte</em></span> and about 9 months later I realized I wanted to go deeper and get more involved in development.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="maincontent">
            <h4><strong>Hobbies:</strong></h4>
              <p><strong>Here is a list of some of my favorite things to do:</strong></p>
                <div class="hobbies">
                  <ul>
                    <li>Gaming</li>
                    <li>Music production</li>
                    <li>Pizza Hut</li>
                    <li>Artsy stuff (Not very good at it though)</li>
                  </ul>
                <h4><strong>Gaming:</strong></h4>
                  <p>I have been a gamer for most my life, at first it was the <em>Nintendo 64</em> I always used to play at my friends house. Then it was the <em>PlayStation 2</em> and shortly after
                  it was the <em>Xbox 360</em>. It wasnt until I got xbox live that it <strong>REALLY</strong> took off as a hobby and changed my life interests and pursuits towards technology. Fast forward to today
                  and you will see that I have been playing on pc every since and have continued to look for a career in tech. (Set up pics in description)</p>
                <h4><strong>Music Production:</strong></h4>
                  <p>Music production is a big fancy word for "I play around in <em>FL Studio</em>". I have made music every now and then for the past couple of years purely for fun.
                  I see it as a productive time waste which is kinda a paradox but what ever. Below is a remix I did of a common video game character know as "Tachanka" from the <em>Rainbowsix</em> games, not good by any means but it was fun to make :).</p>

                <h4><strong>Pizza hut:</strong></h4>
                  <p><em>Pizza Hut</em>is really good, to the point where eating it is a hobby. But I know alot of people dont like it. So heres a little tutorial for ya, eat it after it gets cold and reheat it in the oven (also get stuffed crust aslways).
                  preheat the oven to 400 degres, wait till it reaches that temp, put the pizza in for about 8 minutes and boom amazing pizza hut pizza thats not wet and greasy.</p>
                <h4><strong>Art:</strong></h4>
                  <p><em>This technically goes in with the music production but every now and then I used to draw alot and more so doodle now a days. I really in general just love the process of creation which
                  is also another reason I am learning web development, its another means of learning how to create something.</p>
